    <h1> E-wallet </h1>
    <p>
        Digital wallet or electronic wallet, which is an electronic application that organizes all financial movements. This wallet contains all user data for that card in an encrypted form, and is therefore installed on a personal computer or stored on a hard disk or any other tool through which such data can be saved and used To pay via the Internet. Digital wallets appeared due to the urgent need to use them and ease of communication via the Internet, and the consequent facilitation of operations such as purchases, which include small or large cash transfers, and thus the speed of their arrival to the other party. There are many large companies and banks that use electronic wallet technology through Internet pages, by using devices supported by many secure programs, in addition to a protocol called (Secure Financial Movements Protocol), which is called Layer Secure Socket.
